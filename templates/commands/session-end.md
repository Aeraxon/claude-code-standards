# Session End

Execute the following steps:

1. **Summarize session** into `docs/session_notes.md`:
   - Add new entry at TOP of file with timestamp
   - Brief, technical summary: what was accomplished, key decisions, current state
   - Use bullet points, be token-efficient
   - Format: `## Session YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` as header

2. **Archive work_in_progress.md**:
   - Move `docs/work_in_progress.md` to `docs/archive/wip_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`
   - Create directory if needed
   - Create fresh empty `docs/work_in_progress.md`

3. **Update subagents.md** if subagents were added/removed/modified

Confirm completion with brief summary of what was archived.
